-- The Concept --

Mozilla's Popcorn.js ( http://popcornjs.org ) adds interactive media to video timelines.  It works across HTML5 <video>, YouTube, and Vimeo videos.

In my experience with Popcorn.js, I spent a great deal of time and energy tagging and un-tagging people throughout the video timeline.  Why set up each video as a brand new system, without recognizing meta-data and Twitter profiles as sources of information?

The viewer side connects you to social media profiles you can use to follow up with speakers and reporters in the video.

The editor side of this system is remarkably simple.  As you watch the video, you can drag profiles in and out of editing space.  This creates the timeline meta-data that Popcorn.js uses to construct the interview.

The timeline (created from an HTML5 <video> in videoderive.html) should be posted on the same server as the video file and be served over localhost or the internet.  Every few frames, the average color is added as a band to the timeline, allowing you to navigate the video in a new and memorable way.  If incorporated into the player, this would also allow you to see which parts of the video you have yet to watch.
